# P8105 Homework1 by AA4266

In this homework, we have tried to build upon the concepts learned under the *Building Blocks* topic.
Worked on the use of R Markdown, GitHub and R Projects to make a reproducible report that can be available for collaboration.

**Under problem 1**, we made a data frame with dimensions (10,4), named problem1_df. Each column being of different data types, i.e. numeric, logica, character and factor respectively.

We then worked on explicit conversion of variable data types through as.numeric, as.factor, as.character functions and observe the outputs.

**Under problem 2**, we made another data frame with dimensions (1000, 5), named problem2_df. We worked on inline R codes using this data frame's vectors. 

We moved on to make scatterplots using the data frame made under problem 2.
